# Bayesian-Network-for-Diabetes-Diagnosis-and-Dietary-Recommendations

This project addresses two pressing healthcare challenges: diagnosing Type 2 Diabetes early and improving dietary choices for individuals with varying glycemic needs.

## Core Contributions: 

1) Developed a Bayesian Network to estimate diabetes risk using clinical data (glucose levels, BMI, family history, etc.). 

2) Integrated a decision-making framework to recommend diets based on glycemic index (low, medium, high) and health outcomes.

## Key Insights:

 •Probabilistic Diagnosis: Enhanced detection accuracy for diabetes risk, even with limited initial data.

 •Actionable Recommendations: Enabled tailored dietary advice to minimize glycemic impact, improving quality of life for diabetic and prediabetic individuals.

## Interesting Results:
 
 • For diabetics, low-GI foods maximized health utility.
 
 • Prediabetics benefited most from medium-GI diets, balancing energy needs and glucose management.
 
 • Custom cases, like an athlete or an expectant mother, demonstrated how the model adapts to diverse profiles.

Technologies Used: Python, Bayesian Inference, Data Visualization, Network Analysis.

Why It Matters:  Diabetes affects millions, with many undiagnosed. This project demonstrates the power of AI to provide scalable, impactful solutions in healthcare.
